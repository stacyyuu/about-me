                <p class = "intro"> Hello! My name is Stacy. </p>

                    <p>I am an aspiring Software Developer who has just begun my 
                    journey at Code Fellows. I am so excited to learn what it takes to become a successful developer. </p>
                <p>I currently work as Dental Hygienist and have been practicing for three years. I received my Bachelor
                     of Applied Science in Dental Hygiene in 2019. I attended Lake Washington Institute of Technology in Kirkland, WA.</p>
                <p>During the pandemic, I contemplated changing fields for many reasons. One of those reasons being, having the option to 
                    work remote. I decided to finally give that dream a try and joined Code Fellows.</p>
                <p>My experience started in the beginning of 2022, which consisted of self-studying. After a couple of weeks trying
                     to learn by myself, I realized I would do a lot better with guidance. My goal is to become a competent developer and hopefully land a job at a company that I love!</p>
